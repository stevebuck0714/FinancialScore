## 📊 How It Works

### Upload → Map → Calculate → Display

```
1. USER uploads CSV/Excel file (24+ months of data)
   ↓
2. APP auto-detects column names (Date, Revenue, Expense, etc.)
   ↓
3. USER confirms or adjusts column mappings
   ↓
4. APP normalizes data to monthly totals
   ↓
5. APP calculates:
   • LTM Revenue vs Prior LTM → Growth %
   • Revenue Growth Score (RGS) based on bands
   • 6-month adjustment curve
   • Spread bonus (if applicable)
   • Balance sheet ratios
   ↓
6. APP displays:
   • Income Statement metrics
   • Balance Sheet snapshot
   • Key financial ratios
   • FINAL SCORE (0-130)
```

## 🎯 Scoring System

### Revenue Growth Score (24-month)
| Growth % | RGS Points |
|----------|------------|
| ≥ 25% | 100 |
| 20-25% | 90 |
| 15-20% | 80 |
| 10-15% | 70 |
| 5-10% | 60 |
| 0-5% | 50 |
| -5 to 0% | 40 |
| -10 to -5% | 30 |
| -15 to -10% | 20 |
| < -15% | 10 |

### 6-Month Adjustment
Recent performance modifies the RGS:
- **Strong growth (≥25%):** +50 points
- **Good growth (15-25%):** 80% of gap to 100
- **Moderate growth (5-15%):** 60% of gap to 100
- **Slight growth (0-5%):** 40% of gap to 100
- **Slight decline (0 to -5%):** 90% of RGS
- **Moderate decline (-5 to -15%):** 70% of RGS
- **Strong decline (-15 to -25%):** 50% of RGS
- **Severe decline (< -25%):** 30% of RGS

### Spread Bonus
If **(Revenue Growth% - Expense Growth%) > 10pp**: **+30 bonus points**

### Final Calculation
```
Final Score = min(130, max(0, Adjusted RGS + Spread Bonus))
```
