## üîç Database Verification

Open **Prisma Studio** (http://localhost:5555) and verify:

### Tables to Check:
- [ ] **users** - Should have: site admin, consultants, company users
- [ ] **consultants** - Should have consultant records
- [ ] **companies** - Should have test companies
- [ ] **financial_records** - Should have uploaded data
- [ ] **monthly_financials** - Should have parsed monthly data
- [ ] **assessment_records** - Should have saved assessments
- [ ] **company_profiles** - Should have profile data
- [ ] **audit_logs** - (Will be populated when we add logging)

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" errors
**Solution**: Make sure Next.js dev server is running (`npm run dev`)

### Issue: Login fails
**Solution**: 
- Check database has site admin: `npm run db:studio`
- Try re-seeding: `npm run db:seed`

### Issue: Data not loading
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API routes are accessible
- Check Prisma Studio to see if data is in DB

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Solution**:
- Run: `npx prisma generate` to regenerate Prisma Client
- Restart Next.js dev server

### Issue: "Unable to connect to database"
**Solution**:
- Check `prisma/dev.db` file exists

## üìä What's Working

### ‚úÖ Implemented & Tested:
- User authentication (login/register)
- Company management (create/delete/update)
- User management (add/delete)
- Consultant management
- Financial data upload
- Assessment questionnaire
- Company profiles
- All calculations (scores, KPIs, projections)
- All visualizations (charts, graphs)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Still Using localStorage (Temporary):
- Projection defaults (minor)
- Assessment current responses (temporary state)
- Some UI state (selected items, etc.)

**Note**: localStorage fallback is intentional for now. Core data is in database.

---

## üéØ Performance Check

### Expected Behavior:
- Login: < 500ms
- Load companies: < 300ms
- Load users: < 200ms
- Upload financial data: < 2s (depending on file size)
- Save assessment: < 500ms
- Navigate between pages: Instant (data already loaded)

### If Slow:
- SQLite is local file-based (very fast)
- If issues, check console for errors
- May need database indexing optimization

---

## üöÄ After Testing Successfully

### Next Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Document any bugs found
2. ‚úÖ Fix critical issues
3. ‚úÖ Clean up localStorage code (optional)
4. ‚úÖ Add remaining polish features
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è When ready: Switch to MySQL for Vercel

### To Deploy to Vercel (When Ready):
```bash
# 1. Update schema to MySQL
# Edit prisma/schema.prisma: provider = "mysql"

# 2. Set up PlanetScale
# Get connection string

# 3. Update .env for production
DATABASE_URL="mysql://..."

# 4. Run migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 5. Seed production database
npm run db:seed

# 6. Deploy to Vercel
# Push to GitHub, connect to Vercel, deploy!
```
